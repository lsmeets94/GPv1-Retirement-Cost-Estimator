[![CI](https://github.com/microsoft/GPv1-Retirement-Cost-Estimator/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/microsoft/GPv1-Retirement-Cost-Estimator/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FGPv1-Retirement-Cost-Estimator%2Fmain%2Finfra%2Fazuredeploy.json)

> **If the Deploy to Azure button shows a download error**, the repository may not yet be publicly accessible. Download [`infra/azuredeploy.json`](./infra/azuredeploy.json) manually, then open the [Azure Portal custom deployment editor](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template), choose **Build your own template in the editor**, and paste the file contents there.

Azure-hostable web app for estimating the billing impact of upgrading Azure Storage GPv1 accounts to GPv2 using public Azure list pricing.

> 📖 **Ready to deploy?** See [docs/deployment.md](./docs/deployment.md) for all deployment options including one-click Azure deployment, manual ARM template deployment, and GitHub Actions setup.

## Deployment

Click the **Deploy to Azure** badge above (or use the ARM template at `infra/azuredeploy.json`) to provision an Azure Static Web App in your subscription.

To enable the automated deploy workflow after forking:

1. Click the **Deploy to Azure** badge above to provision an Azure Static Web App in your subscription.
2. In the Azure portal, open the Static Web App resource and copy its **deployment token** (Manage deployment token).
3. In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add a secret named `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN` with that token.
4. Push to `main` or trigger the Deploy workflow manually.

See [docs/deployment.md](./docs/deployment.md) for full deployment options.

## What It Does

- Accepts manual GPv1 Blob Storage usage or structured CSV billing line items.
- Detects Blob Storage rows and excludes Azure Files, Disks, Tables, and Queues by default.
- Looks up public prices through the Azure Retail Prices API.
- Shows GPv1 vs GPv2 list-price and discount-adjusted cost comparisons.
- Flags matches as Exact match, Strong match, Needs review, or Unmatched.
- Exports a customer-ready CSV and PDF summary.

## Repository Layout

- `apps/web` - React + TypeScript + Vite frontend.
- `apps/api` - Azure Functions-compatible TypeScript API.
- `packages/core` - shared CSV parsing, pricing URL construction, matching, calculations, and exports.
- `docs` - deployment and calculation methodology.
- `apps/web/public/sample-usage.csv` - sample CSV template and test data.

## Local Development

```powershell
npm install
npm run build
npm run test
npm run dev
```

For live Retail Prices API lookups during local development, run the API in a separate terminal:

```powershell
npm run build -w @gpv2-estimator/core
npm run build -w @gpv2-estimator/api
npm run start -w @gpv2-estimator/api
```

Then open the Vite URL shown by `npm run dev`.

## Environment Variables

No secrets are required.

For Azure Functions local development, copy `apps/api/local.settings.example.json` to `apps/api/local.settings.json`.

## Pricing Source

The API uses the unauthenticated Azure Retail Prices API:

`https://prices.azure.com/api/retail/prices?api-version=2023-01-01-preview`

Prices are filtered by Storage service family, Consumption price type, region, currency, and available meter hints. The response keeps meter IDs and public meter details visible in the UI.

## CI/CD

The repository includes two GitHub Actions workflows:

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — runs on every push and pull request to `main`. Runs tests, typecheck, lint, build, and a production dependency audit. No secrets required.
- **Deploy** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) — runs on every push to `main` and can be triggered manually. Deploys to Azure Static Web Apps.

## Important Limits

This app is an estimator. It does not model taxes, credits, reservations, support plans, marketplace charges, private negotiated pricing, or customer-specific billing APIs. Discounts are modeled only when entered by the user.
